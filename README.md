# GUI for Scientific Database
This is a simple GUI made for a Scientific Database. The GUI is built using CustomTkinter and Tkinter. At the backend, SQLite is used for its serverless capability. The project requires further development. 
Youâ€™re free to do anything with this code. Further development will be done over time.

## Usage
To use, first Execute the DBcreate.py file. there about 5 tables in this file. to create additional tables use `c.execute('''<SQL Query>''')`.
A SQLite database is created when the file is executed.
## Note: 
Adding a table should be followed by modifications to th `DBgui.py` file. Since radio buttons are used to access the tables, any new table should have a corresponding radio button added, and the logic for it should be coded.


Install CustomTkinter
```
pip install customtkinter
```
then Execute DBgui.py to get the GUI
the RadioButton play a key role in this GUI to insert in or Display a any table, RadioButton with that tabel name is to be marked
